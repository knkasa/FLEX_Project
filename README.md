# FLEX_Project
Fully self-consistent, two orbital FLEX code in the superconducting state.  
FLEX(Fluctuation exchange) is an approximation scheme used to study superconducting properties of materials.  
In "code" branch, you will find a folder "FLEX_two_orbital".
All the necessary files can be found there.
